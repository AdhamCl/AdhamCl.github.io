    <h1>Privacy Policy for GitHub Profile App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 22, 2024</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how GitHub Profile ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our application ("App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use our App, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Profile Information:</strong> When you enter your GitHub username, we fetch your public profile information from the GitHub API. This includes your username, profile picture, bio, repositories, and other publicly available information.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect any usage data; we only display your GitHub profile information. All data is retrieved in real-time from the GitHub API and is not stored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not use any personal information. The app only fetches and displays your GitHub profile information temporarily. When you close the app, any information displayed is deleted and not retained.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except as required by law or to comply with legal processes. The information collected from the GitHub API is public, and we display it as it is provided by GitHub.</p>

    <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously. We implement reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in our App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
